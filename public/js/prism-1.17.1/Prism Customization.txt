**
    Prism has been upgraded to 1.22.0 on the site.
    This version will be kept for some time in case users who have previously
    viewed the site or a page that links to it still see it and so all references
    can be removed. For developers who downloaded an older copy of the site
    this will still be linked too so it will probably be a while before it
    should be deleted.

    Switched to [1.22.0] on 2020-12-05
**

This project is using a custom version of Prism to prevent contents of:
    <script type="text/x-template">
from being highlighted as JavaScript. The actual update is expected to change with
different versions of prism so any update requires verification of all example code.
